In order to compile and install PM 0.3 you will need:

A Fortran compiler - F95 with allocatable components TR: ISO/IEC TR 15581:2001 (almost any compiler)

A version of MPI (so far tested with OpenMPI)

To compile goto src/pm and make

You may need to edit the Makefile - sorry no ./configure yet!

You can edit sysdep.f90 - but are very unlikely to need to do so.

To run:
 
./pm module_name          --> file will be module_name.pmm
./pm module_name.pmm

To use more than one process/core:

mpirun ... ./pm module_name   

This is an early release so is likely to have bugs!
