In order to compile and install PM you will need:

A Fortran compiler - F95 with allocatable components TR: ISO/IEC TR 15581:2001 (almost any compiler)

A version of MPI (so far tested with OpenMPI)

You may need to edit the Makefile - sorry no ./configure yet!

You can edit sysdep.f90 - but are very unlikely to need to do so.

This is an early release so is likely to have bugs!
