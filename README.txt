The PM Programming Language is designed to facilitate the creation

of numerical models on parallel systems. It combines concepts of

parallelisation and vectorisation into a unified model.


For a more complete project description see www.pm-lang.org

The language specification (available in /doc) while incomplete in places, will give

a good view of the features of the version 0.1 of the language.
    

The code is not quite ready to start playing with yet - unless you

are very into compiler/interpreter design. A full working release

of version 0.1 is planned before the end on Feb 2015.
