The PM Programming Language is designed to facilitate the creation

of numerical models on parallel systems. It combines concepts of

parallelisation and vectorisation into a unified model.


For a more complete project description see www.pm-lang.org

The language specification (available in /doc) while incomplete in places, will give

a good view of the features of the version 0.3 of the language.
    

This is an initial (not stable) release of version 0.3 of the language.

Some features are missing/incomplete - including

- integer and real types with defined bit size (int16, real32, etc.)

- cyclic and block cyclic distributions


Watch out for continuing updates.
