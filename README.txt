The PM Programming Language is designed to facilitate the creation

of numerical models on parallel systems. It combines concepts of

parallelisation and vectorisation into a unified model.


For a more complete project description see www.pm-lang.org

The language specification (available in /doc) while incomplete in places, will give

a good view of the features of the version 0.1 of the language.
    

Most of the single-node part of the language - including concurrent loops and communicating

operators is now working. Types are currently restricted to int, long and bool, with some support for

strings.


Look out for updates over the next month or so.
